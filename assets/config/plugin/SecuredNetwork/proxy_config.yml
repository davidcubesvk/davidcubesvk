#
#Connection to SecuredNetwork on Spigot servers:
connection:
  #Type of the connection (more and detailed info can be found on the wiki):
  #- FILE: connection provided by data.yml file created in plugin's data folder
  #- SOCKET: connection using sockets
  #- DATABASE: connection using a database
  type: SOCKET
  #Socket port (if type = SOCKET):
  socket-port: 4444
  #Database connection (if type = DATABASE):
  database:
    #Host:
    host: ""
    #Port:
    port: 3306
    #Username:
    username: ""
    #Password:
    password: ""
    #Database:
    database: ""
    #Table:
    table: "securednetwork"
    #SSL mode (encrypted communication):
    #- DISABLED: establish unencrypted connections
    #- PREFERRED: establish encrypted connections if the server enabled them (otherwise, unencrypted connections will be established)
    #- REQUIRED: require encrypted connections
    #INFO: All modes all listed at https://dev.database.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-reference-configuration-properties.html#sslMode.
    ssl-mode: PREFERRED
    #Timeout configuration:
    timeout:
      #Time for the plugin to connect to the database server until the connection request times out (in milliseconds):
      #INFO! You can (should) adjust this by the speed of your database (connection). Set to 0 for no timeout.
      connect: 2000
      #Time for each operation to finish until it times out (in milliseconds):
      #INFO! You can (should) adjust this by the speed of your database (connection). Set to 0 for no timeout.
      socket: 2000
      #If connection has been unexpectedly closed (internet connection failure etc.), wait for this amount of seconds before connecting again:
      reconnect: 3
    #Statement pool sizes:
    #INFO! Statements send requests to the database and process what comes in the return. The sending process of such a statement
    #      includes compiling of it's request, which takes some time. Once the request is compiled, it can be sent immediately.
    #      The advantage of this is that statements can be reused, so there's a statement pool. This ,,pool" contains these compiled
    #      statements. A statement is taken from the pool when a operation needs to be executed, operation finishes and then it's
    #      returned to be reused. That's because one statement can't be used by more than 1 caller at the same time.
    #      Each time player joins (or quits) the server, one statement operation is needed. You should adjust the values below
    #      approximately how many player's join (or quit) your server through this proxy at the same time and how long one operation
    #      takes. If no statement is available in the pool (all of them are in use), this is not a problem, just the statement needs
    #      to be compiled, which will make a latency of some milliseconds.
    #NOTE! Each statement in the pool takes memory as it is compiled. Please adjust the value by the recommendations given above,
    #      but also think about how much RAM do you have. You do not have to fill your RAM completely, adjust the value perfectly.
    statement-pool-size:
      #Pool size for writing operations (when a player joins):
      write: 10
      #Pool size for deleting operations (when a player quits):
      delete: 10
#Disconnect messages (use \n for new line):
disconnect:
  #If player tries to connect to the server with not whitelisted IP:
  whitelist: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] &cPlease connect with IP: yourserver.com!"
  #If the connection is not established and player tries to join:
  failure: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] &cWe are now having technical problems.\n\n&cPlease try again in a while."
  #If player tries to connect as player that's already online:
  online: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] &cAlready connected to the server!\n\n&cIf you believe this is an error, contact staff."
  #If plugin reloaded:
  reload: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] &cPlugin reloaded.\n\n&cPlease rejoin."
#Logging:
log:
  #Enable logging (recommended = false, in case you don't have any problem or error):
  enabled: true
  #Enable or disable logging of specific messages:
  specific:
    #[CONNECTOR] messages:
    connector:
      #Include the IP with which player connects to the server:
      virtual-host-address: false
    #[SOCKET] messages:
    socket:
      #Log the CHECK_CONNECTION data input message (if connection.type = SOCKET):
      #INFO! Connection messages are also logged - e.g. data input and output of socket, what is being written in the database.
      #      If using socket connection, SecuredNetwork on Spigot sends the CHECK_CONNECTION message to SecuredNetwork on proxy to check the connection.
      #      Checking connection is set to every second (can be changed at connection.socket.timeout.check-connection), so you get this message
      #      every one second in log file. This may lead to 4.3MB/24h logs only from this message.
      check-connection: false
#IP whitelisting:
ip-whitelist:
  #Enable:
  enabled: false
  #Whitelisted IPs - these should be the proxy IPs (these are just examples, please, delete them if you want to use this feature):
  #INFO: 1. To enable all hostnames, insert *. prefix before the whitelisted IP, e.g. *.yourserver.com will allow players connecting with
  #         abc.yourserver.com, xyz.yourserver.com..., (useful for servers with AntiDDoS service).
  #      2. To apply whitelisted IP without hostnames, insert only the IP without any prefix, e.g. yourserver.com will allow only players
  #         connecting with yourserver.com.
  #      3. If your server has dynamic IP, use {ip} placeholder as the server's IP (useful for dynamic IP servers).
  #      4. To allow case-insensitive hostname comparing for the current IP, insert "[CASE_INSENSITIVE]" or "[CASE_SENSITIVE]"
  #         (for case-sensitive comparing) right before the IP as shown in example IPs below. If not inserted, the default
  #         setting is case-sensitive.
  #NOTE: You don't need to write ports there. SecuredNetwork will automatically obtain port where is BungeeCord server hosted on.
  #      However, if you write port there, BungeeCord port will be overridden by specified port.
  ips:
    - 'yourserver.com'
    - 'localhost'
    - '[NOT_CASE_SENSITIVE]abc.yourserver.com'
  #Website for obtaining the {ip} placeholder (any website with only one line displayed on your browser - your IP):
  ip-website: "https://checkip.amazonaws.com/"
#Update checker:

  #Enable checking for updates:

  #Delay between re-checking for updates in minutes (set to -1 to check only once):

  #              {version_current} - currently used plugin version
