# Property used to forward the passphrase to a backend server:
property:
  # Name of the property (can not be "textures"):
  name: "secured_network"
  # Value of the property - the actual passphrase (the longer it is, the better):
  value: ""
# Disconnect message sent to the player if:
# - Info: "\n" can be used for a new line.
disconnect:
  # A not whitelisted IP was used to join the server:
  whitelist: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] &cPlease connect with IP: yourserver.com!"
  # An error occurred while setting the passphrase into the connection:
  passphrase-error: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] &cAn error occurred while processing your request.\n\n&7&oPlease try again later."
# Enable the plugin's own logging system:
# - Info: Plugin's log files are saved into "logs" folder in it's plugin folder. It is recommended to have it disabled if
#       you are not encountering any problems and/or errors.
log: false
# IP whitelisting:
ip-whitelist:
  # Enable:
  enabled: false
  # Whitelisted IPs - these should be the proxy IPs / DNS names (these are just examples, please, delete them if you want to use this feature):
  # - Info: 1. To allow all hostnames, insert *. prefix before the whitelisted IP, e.g. "*.yourserver.com" will allow 
  #          players connecting with "abc.yourserver.com", "xyz.yourserver.com"...
  #       2. To block any hostname for a IP, simply insert only the IP without any hostname - e.g. "yourserver.com" will
  #          allow only players connecting with "yourserver.com".
  #       3. If your server has dynamic IP, use the "{ip}" placeholder as the server's IP.
  #       4. To allow case-insensitive hostname comparing for the current IP, insert "[CASE_INSENSITIVE]" prefix right
  #          before the IP as shown in an example IP below. The "[CASE_SENSITIVE]" prefix indicates case-sensitive
  #          comparing. If there's no prefix, the IP is compared case-sensitively.
  #       5. Writing a port is recommended but not required. If not specified, the plugin will automatically use
  #          the port on which is the proxy server hosted.
  ips:
    - "{ip}:25577"
    - "yourserver.com"
    - "localhost"
    - "[NOT_CASE_SENSITIVE]abc.yourserver.com"
  # Website used to obtain the value of the "{ip}" placeholder:
  # - Info: This should be a website that returns only your IP on the GET request (if you open it on your browser).
