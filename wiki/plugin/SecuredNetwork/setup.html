    <!--Installation-->
    <h1 class="title" id="step-1">1. Installation:</h1>
    <!--Text-->
    <p>Download the latest version of the plugin available from the official
      plugin page on SpigotMC. Put the .jar file into the plugins folder of all
      your servers (backend and proxy servers) and restart them.</p>

    <!--Generating a new passphrase-->
    <h1 class="title" id="step-2">2. Generating a new passphrase:</h1>
    <!--Text-->
    <p>Each player has his data representation called GameProfile. This object
      contains data such as the player UUID, or properties. Properties are used
      to store skin textures (if the server is in online-mode). These properties
      are then forwarded to the backend server by the proxy. On the proxy,
      SecuredNetwork inserts a passphrase into these properties. Backend servers
      then verify it and if the configured passphrase and the received one equal,
      the connection is accepted.<br>
      Therefore, the passphrase should be unique and completely random. Open the
      console on any of your proxy servers and use command
      <code>/sn generate &#60;length&#62;</code>. The <code>length</code> argument
      indicates the length of the newly-generated passphrase. It should be greater
      than <code>0</code> and the longer the new passphrase is, the better.
      In fact, there's no upper limit on this value, but don't enter too big, like
      <code>1000000000</code> or so, as it will take longer for slower connections
      to login (every character of the passphrase is 1 byte, a length of 1 million
      characters is 1MB of traffic). Recommended value is <code>1000</code>. The
      generated passphrase was automatically saved into the config.yml file of
      SecuredNetwork.</p>

    <!--Applying the passphrase-->
    <h1 class="title" id="step-3">3. Applying the passphrase:</h1>
    <!--Text-->
    <p>The command also prompted you to reload to apply the passphrase now. We
      will do it later. Now, open the config.yml file of the plugin and copy the
      passphrase located under <code>property.value</code>. Then, paste the
      passphrase into <code>property.value</code> in all config.yml files of
      SecuredNetwork plugin (on all proxy and backend servers). Simply make sure,
      that <code>property.value</code> fields equal in all config.yml files. To
      apply the passphrase, run <code>/sn reload</code> on all your servers.</p>

    <!--The second passphrase-->
    <h1 class="title" id="step-4">4. The second passphrase:</h1>
    <!--Text-->
    <p><i>This step is completely optional.</i> As properties are identified by
      their names and store a value (passphrase is the value), this option is also
      configurable in all config.yml files under <code>property.name</code>. If
      you want, you can use this as the second passphrase. Just, make sure all
      <code>property.name</code> fields in all config.yml files equal and reload
      all plugins again.</p>

    <!--IP whitelisting-->
    <h1 class="title" id="step-5">5. IP-whitelisting:</h1>
    <!--Text-->
    <p><i>This step is completely optional.</i> If you want to restrict the
      players to use only your domain, not the numeric IP, etc., you can, thanks
      to the IP-whitelisting feature.</p>
    <p>Each player connecting with any of these IPs will be allowed to connect,
      others will get disconnected during the logging in process. You can
      whitelist number-IPs, domains, hostnames and ports. At first, set
      <code>enabled:</code> to <code>true</code> in the config.yml file of
      SecuredNetwork on the proxy to enable the IP-whitelist feature. Then,
      whitelist IPs by adding them to <code>ips</code> list following these
      rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Whitelisting ports</strong> - Easily, just specify the IP and
          the wanted port separated with a colon, for example
          <code>yourserver.com:25565</code> will allow players connecting only
          with this IP and port. If not specified, SecuredNetwork will obtain and
          use the port on which is the proxy server hosted. For example, you have
          the proxy server hosted on port <code>25565</code> and you have
          whitelisted <code>yourserver.com</code>, player connecting with the port
          <code>25565</code> and this domain will be allowed (with
          <code>yourserver.com:25565</code>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Whitelisting hostnames</strong> - Hostnames can be
          whitelisted easily by adding them in front of the IP, for example
          <code>mc.yourserver.com</code> will allow players connecting with
          <code>mc.yourserver.com</code> (see the upper point if you'd like to
          know how ports work). If you want to allow all hostnames, use
          <code>*.</code> wildcard as hostname before the IP; this means
          <code>*.yourserver.com</code> will allow players connecting with
          <code>abc.yourserver.com</code>, <code>xyz.yourserver.com</code> etc.,
          but it will not allow players connecting with
          <code>yourserver.com</code> (without any hostname).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>For servers with dynamic IP address</strong> - If the machine
          on which is your proxy server hosted has dynamic IP (it's IP changes
          every server restart), just use placeholder <code>{ip}</code> as a
          replacement for the machine's IP. As it is just a replacement, you can
          specify ports, hostnames, without any problems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>IP comparing prefixes</strong> - IPs (the one used by player
          and a whitelisted IP) are compared case-sensitively by default. To
          change the coparision mode, insert <code>[CASE_SENSITIVE]</code> or
          <code>[CASE_INSENSITIVE]</code> prefix before the IP. For example,
          <code>[CASE_INSENSITIVE]abc.yourserver.com</code> will also allow
          players connecting with <code>aBc.yoUrSerVer.com</code>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have more than one proxy, replicate the process for each of them.
      Additionally, don't forget to run <code>/sn reload</code> on all your proxy
      servers.</p>

    <!--Finish-->
    <h1 class="title" id="step-6">6. Finish:</h1>
    <!--Text-->
    <p>Congratulations, you have finished the setup process of SecuredNetwork
      plugin.</p>
